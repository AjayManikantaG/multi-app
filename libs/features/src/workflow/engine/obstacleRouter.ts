/**
 * obstacleRouter.ts
 * 
 * CORE REQUIREMENT: Obstacle-aware Manhattan routing engine.
 * 
 * How it works:
 * 1. Uses @joint/core's built-in `routers.manhattan` as the base
 * 2. Dynamically filters obstacles per-link:
 *    - Source and target elements are NEVER treated as obstacles
 *    - All other (unconnected) elements ARE obstacles
 * 3. Recalculates routes automatically when elements move, resize, rotate,
 *    or when links are reconnected
 * 
 * Architecture:
 * - `getObstacleRouterConfig(graph, sourceId?, targetId?)` — returns router config for a single link
 * - `applyRoutingListeners(paper, graph)` — attaches event listeners for dynamic recalculation
 * - `rerouteAllLinks(graph)` — forces all links to recalculate their routes
